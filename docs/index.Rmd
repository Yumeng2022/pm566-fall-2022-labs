## Question 1: How many sars-cov-2 papers?
Build an automatic counter of sars-cov-2 papers using PubMed. 
```{r}
# Downloading the website
website <- xml2::read_html("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2")

# Finding the counts
counts <- xml2::xml_find_first(website, "/html/body/main/div[9]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/span")

# Turning it into text
counts <- as.character(counts)

# Extracting the data using regex
stringr::str_extract(counts, "[0-9,]+")
```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
