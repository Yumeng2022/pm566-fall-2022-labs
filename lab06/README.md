## Question 1: What specialties do we have?

We can use count() from dplyr to figure out how many records are there
per specialty?

``` r
specialties=
  mts %>%
  count(medical_specialty)

specialties %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
knitr::kable()
```

There are 40 medical specialties.

``` r
specialties %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x= n, y= fct_reorder(medical_specialty, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

    ## Selecting by n

![](README_files/figure-gfm/barplot-of-specialty-counts-1.png)<!-- -->

The distribution is not at all uniform.

## Question 2: Visualize the top 20 most frequent words in the transcription column

-   Tokenize the the words in the transcription column
-   Count the number of times each token appears
-   Visualize the top 20 most frequent words

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  #anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word")) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(word, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/token-transcription-1.png)<!-- -->

There are a lot of stop words here, non-specific to medical text, We do
see “patient”.

## Question 3: Redo analysis in Q2, amd remove stopwords

-   Redo visualization but remove stopwords before
-   Bonus points if you remove numbers as well

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, transcription) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word")) %>%
  # use regular expression to filter out numbers (not match 0-9)
  filter( !grepl(pattern= "^[0-9]+$", x= word)) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(word, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

It give us a much better idea of what the text is about after getting
rid of the stopwords and numbers.

## Question 4

repeat question 2, but this time tokenize into bi-grams. how does the
result change if you look at tri-grams?

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_ngrams(bigram, transcription, n=2) %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(bigram, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/bigrams-transcription-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
mts %>%
  unnest_ngrams(trigram, transcription, n=3) %>%
  count(trigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(20, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(trigram, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/trigrams-transcription-1.png)<!-- -->

Top 20 trigrams seemed to find a few more medical word group than
bigrams.

## Question 5

Using the results you got from questions 4. Pick a word and count the
words that appears after and before it.

``` r
ptbigram =
  mts %>%
  unnest_ngrams(bigram, transcription, n=2) %>%
  separate(bigram, into = c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  select(word1, word2) %>%
  filter(word1 == "patient" | word2 == "patient")
```

Words appearing before patient:

``` r
ptbigram %>%
  filter(word2 == "patient") %>%
  count(word1, sort=T) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by= c("word1"= "word")) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
knitr::kable()
```

    ## Selecting by n

| word1       |   n |
|:------------|----:|
| history     | 101 |
| procedure   |  32 |
| female      |  26 |
| sample      |  23 |
| male        |  22 |
| illness     |  16 |
| plan        |  16 |
| indications |  15 |
| allergies   |  14 |
| correct     |  11 |
| detail      |  11 |

Words appearing after patient:

``` r
ptbigram %>%
  filter(word1 == "patient") %>%
  count(word2, sort=T) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by= c("word2"= "word")) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
knitr::kable()
```

    ## Selecting by n

| word2      |   n |
|:-----------|----:|
| tolerated  | 994 |
| denies     | 552 |
| underwent  | 180 |
| received   | 160 |
| reports    | 155 |
| understood | 113 |
| lives      |  81 |
| admits     |  69 |
| appears    |  68 |
| including  |  67 |

## Question 6

Which words are most used in each of the specialties. you can use
group_by() and top_n() from dplyr to have the calculations be done
within each specialty. Remember to remove stopwords. How about the most
5 used words?

## Question 7 - extra

Find your own insight in the data:

Ideas:

Interesting ngrams See if certain words are used more in some
specialties then others
